Hello fellow dev. In this guide you'll find everything you need to know to add your own contribution to Kite.
This document contains a summary of the elements constituing the outer layer of Kite (You shouldn't need any access to the core).
Also, as usual, this guide might get quickly updated because we are dev. So if you have any questions, you can poke me at mc2m@uplinklabs.net .

Here's a suggestion of how you should follow the guide

1 - Getting Started (you are here !)
2 - Package
3 - Data
4 - functionalities
5 - GUI
    A - Components
    B - Interface
6 - Testing

Enjoy !
