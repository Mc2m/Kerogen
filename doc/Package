The first thing you need to know when creating a mod for Kite is that everything you create will be contained in packages.
A Kite package contains everything that will be executed in the core.
You can find an example of package in Base, which is also the package you'll rely on a lot.

Here's a list of what you can find in a package:

data                The data you want to load on the core or keep for yourself
fonts               The fonts that you'll use.
functionalities     The functionalities of a device. You can describe working process of a phone or a computer there.
companies           The companies contains files describing the working process of companies.
generator           The generators that you use to create the elements of Kite's world.
gui                 The elements constituing the graphical interface.

All these names are important because that's how the package importer will differenciate what file goes where.
When creating a package, keep in mind that you can use files from any other packages.
The Base package will be extremely useful in that matter because it will contains stuff like drop-down menus, scrollbars, base fonts,...

If your package depends on another one, you'll need to create a dependency file and write the name of the packages.
This will allow the package manager to install your package correctly on other machines.

You don't need to worry about overwriting any component from other packages because Kite will choose automatically depending on user preferences.

You can upload your package on one of our servers once it is ready by using the package manager in Kite.
If you want to add a description for that package you can write a readme file on the root of your package.
Note that your package might have a certification. Certified package will be tested by us to ensure that it is safe to use.
To get the certification, you'll have to pay a fee.
That certification might also get you access to more advanced option, should you require it.
