This document contains all you need to know to create the schema file for the graphical interface

The schema is a json file containing the information to design the interface.
It defines the widgets as well as the interface shortcuts.
To see examples of such file, check inside the Base package in gui/interface folder.

The schema is as follow:

{
    "widgets": [list of widgets],
    "shortcuts": [list of shortcuts]
}

Widget description is available in the 5.2.1 Widget part of this guide.

The shortcuts are the key combinations that you will add to an interface.
Each shortcut is a dictionary containing the following attributes:

specialkeys         Used to set a list of special keys to use for the shortcut.
                    The list can contain CTRL,SHIFT,LEFTALT and RIGHTALT.
key                 The key used with the specialkeys to activate the shortcut.
function            The function that will run with the shortcut.
                    Can be taken from default functions (see Widget) or created manually.
